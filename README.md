Proclaimer
==========

An easy, and extensible transactional event notification add on for Spree

Installation
------------

Add proclaimer to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "proclaimer"
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g proclaimer:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to
building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy
app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
